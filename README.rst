Junior Data Scientist Portfolio: Machine Learning Implementations from Scratch
=============================================================================

Welcome to my Junior Data Scientist portfolio! This repository showcases my dedication and expertise in machine learning, with a focus on implementing fundamental algorithms from scratch. Inspired by the teachings of Andrew Ng in the Machine Learning specialization course on Coursera, I have meticulously crafted implementations for essential algorithms, demonstrating my deep understanding of core concepts and strong coding skills.

Algorithms Implemented
----------------------

1. **Simple Linear Regression:**
   Implementation of simple linear regression, a foundational algorithm for predicting numerical values based on a single input feature. My implementation showcases my attention to detail and commitment to mastering the basics of machine learning.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression:**
   Extension to multiple input features, implementing multiple linear regression. This algorithm is vital for real-world predictions where multiple variables influence the outcome. My code reflects my ability to handle complexity and deliver accurate results.

3. **Logistic Regression:**
   Implementation of logistic regression, a key algorithm for binary classification tasks. My implementation demonstrates my proficiency in handling classification problems, a fundamental skill for any data scientist.

4. **Softmax Regression:**
   Implementation of softmax regression for multi-class classification problems. This algorithm is essential when data needs to be classified into more than two classes. My implementation highlights my capability to solve diverse and complex problems.

5. **Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network):**
   Implementation of a multilayer perceptron from scratch, delving into the realm of deep learning. This implementation showcases my ambition to explore advanced topics and my determination to grasp intricate concepts.
