Junior Data Scientist Portfolio: Machine Learning Implementations from Scratch
=============================================================================

Welcome to my Junior Data Scientist portfolio! This repository showcases my dedication and expertise in machine learning, with a focus on implementing fundamental algorithms from scratch. Inspired by the teachings of `Andrew Ng in the Machine Learning specialization <https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?>`_ course on Coursera, I have meticulously crafted implementations for essential algorithms, demonstrating my deep understanding of core concepts and strong coding skills.

Algorithms Implemented
----------------------

1. **Simple Linear Regression:**
   Implementation of simple linear regression, a foundational algorithm for predicting numerical values based on a single input feature.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression:**
   Extension to multiple input features, implementing multiple linear regression. This algorithm is vital for real-world predictions where multiple variables influence the outcome.

3. **Logistic Regression:**
   Implementation of logistic regression, a key algorithm for binary classification tasks.

4. **Softmax Regression:**
   Implementation of softmax regression for multi-class classification problems. This algorithm is essential when data needs to be classified into more than two classes.

5. **Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network):**
   Implementation of a multilayer perceptron from scratch, delving into the realm of deep learning by understandig and implementing Backpropagation from scratch.
   
6. **Decision Tree Classification:**
    Implementation of a Decision Tree algorithm from scratch, a widley used algorithm with intresting data structures and complexities like the vast number of helper functions and tree data strucure.
    
Key Highlights
---------------

- **Deep Understanding:** I have invested substantial time understanding the mathematical foundations and intricacies of these algorithms, enabling me to create robust implementations.

- **Passionate Learner:** My passion for machine learning drives me to explore complex algorithms, ensuring my continuous growth and adaptability in the ever-evolving field of data science.

- **Clean and Efficient Code:** My implementations are not just correct but also optimized and efficient. I believe in writing code that is not only functional but also maintainable and scalable.
